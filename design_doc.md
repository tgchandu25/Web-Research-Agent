# 🧩 Agent Architecture & Tool Integration Documentation

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a Web Research Agent that autonomously processes user queries to generate structured, summarized research reports. It performs real-time search, content scraping, analysis, and synthesis, and delivers results through a user-friendly Gradio interface.

---

## 🧠 Agent Architecture (Start → Stop)
**Flow Summary:**
1. **Start**
2. **User Query:** The user provides a research query, which is broken down into effective search keywords.
3. **Web Scraper Tool (SerpAPI, BeautifulSoup):** 
   - Performs live Google searches using SerpAPI.
   - Scrapes content from the top result pages using BeautifulSoup.
4. **Content Analyzer (GPT-3.5 Turbo):**
   - Processes extracted web content.
   - Summarizes into clear, structured insights.
5. **Report Generation (Structured Summary):** 
   - Compiles the summary into a final research report.
6. **Output to User via Gradio Web Interface:** 
   - Presents the report through an interactive Gradio-based user interface.
7. **Stop**

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

| Tool                    | Purpose                                        |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Gradio**              | Provides the user interface (Blocks layout)    |
| **OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo**| Summarizes extracted content from websites     |
| **SerpAPI**             | Performs Google web search for real-time results |
| **BeautifulSoup**       | Scrapes HTML from top search result pages      |
| **dotenv**              | Loads API keys securely from `.env` file       |

---

## 🔒 Secure Key Handling
- The system uses a `.env` file for API key security.
- API keys are never hardcoded — they are loaded using `python-dotenv`.

---

## ✅ Error Handling & Resilience
- Handles missing or failed SerpAPI lookups gracefully.
- Skips websites where scraping fails without interrupting the process.
- Ensures summarization continues even if content is sparse or noisy.
- Fully supports restarting queries without resetting the system.

---

## 🧪 Testing Strategy
- Includes unit tests to check agent behavior across multiple scenarios.
- `test_cases.py` verifies handling of:
  - Normal and long queries.
  - Empty inputs.
  - Queries with special characters.
  - Scraping failures.
  - Missing API key situations.

---

## 📌 Conclusion
This system is a well-structured AI agent capable of autonomous decision-making, data gathering, analysis, and summarization. The modular design enables easy scaling, tool integration, and reliable performance, making the solution robust and production-ready.
