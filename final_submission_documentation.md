## üß© 1. How the Agent is Structured

The Web Research Agent follows a modular architecture where each function handles a specific task:
- **User Input:** Accepts research queries through a Gradio web interface.
- **Search Engine Integration:** Uses SerpAPI to perform Google searches and fetch top result links.
- **Web Scraping:** Scrapes text content from the result links using BeautifulSoup.
- **Summarization:** Summarizes extracted web content using OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo.
- **Report Generation:** Combines all summaries into a structured report and displays it on the web interface.

The architecture ensures separation of concerns between the search, scrape, and summarization stages, improving maintainability and scalability.

## üìù 2. How the Prompts/Instructions for the AI were Designed

The summarization prompt was crafted to ensure the AI model generates accurate, concise, and meaningful summaries. The key considerations in prompt design were:
- Include **the original user query** to maintain context during summarization.
- Ask the AI to summarize **key findings, latest research, and important points.**
- Explicitly mention **"Make the summary clear and concise"** to avoid long or irrelevant outputs.

**Prompt Example:**
```
The following is some text extracted from websites based on the query: '{query}'. 
Please summarize the key findings, latest research, and important points from this content. 
Make the summary clear and concise.
```

This approach ensures that the AI focuses on relevance and quality while generating summaries.

## üåê 3. How the Agent Connects to and Uses External Tools

### Tools Integrated:
| Tool                | Purpose                                |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **SerpAPI**         | Real-time Google search results        |
| **BeautifulSoup**   | Web scraping of result page content    |
| **OpenAI GPT-3.5**  | Summarization of scraped content       |
| **Gradio**          | Interactive user interface for input/output |
| **dotenv**          | Secure loading of API keys from `.env` file |

### Connection Flow:
1. **Search Query Handling:** SerpAPI fetches search results using an API key from the `.env` file.
2. **Scraping Results:** BeautifulSoup scrapes headers and paragraph tags (`h1`, `h2`, `h3`, `p`) from the search result pages.
3. **Summarization:** Summarization request sent to OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo using the OpenAI API key from `.env`.
4. **Interface:** Gradio Blocks layout enables query input and report output seamlessly through the web interface.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è 4. How the Agent Handles Errors and Unexpected Situations

The agent has built-in error handling at each stage to ensure robustness and smooth operation under various conditions.

| Scenario                              | Handling Strategy                                       |
|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| **SerpAPI failure / missing key**      | Fallback to mock search results for testing             |
| **Scraping failure / broken link**     | Gracefully skips the problematic URL and continues      |
| **Summarization API failure**         | Catches exceptions and returns "Could not summarize the content" |
| **Empty user input**                  | Prevents search from running and prompts the user again |
| **Missing `.env` file or keys**        | Safe key loading using `dotenv`; prevents runtime crashes |

### Example Error Handling Code (Summarization):
```python
try:
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(...)
    summary = response['choices'][0]['message']['content'].strip()
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error during summarization: {e}")
    return "Could not summarize the content."
```

This approach ensures that the agent provides consistent performance even if external services experience issues.
